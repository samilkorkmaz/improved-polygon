import java.awt.Polygon;

/**
 * Polygon class which always returns true when a point lies on one of its edges.<br>
 *
 * Removes problem of "insideness" definition in standard polygon. The standard definition is as follows:<br>
 * A point is considered to lie inside a Shape if and only if:<br>
 * it lies completely inside theShape boundary or<br>
 * it lies exactly on the Shape boundary and the space immediately adjacent to the point in the increasing X direction is entirely inside the boundary<br>
 * or it lies exactly on a horizontal boundary segment and the space immediately adjacent to the point in the increasing Y direction is inside the boundary.<br>
 *
 * Example: xPoints = {0, 5, 10, 15, 15}, yPoints = {0, 5, 3, 10, 0}. According to this definition, contains(5,5), contains(15,10), contains(15, 0) will all
 * return false although these points are on the polygon. ImprovedPolygon returns true for these cases by checking if the input coordinates lie on the edges of
 * the polygon using the line formula y = m*x + n.
